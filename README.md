## 🧠 What I’ve Learned

Here’s a summary of the major concepts I’ve explored through these labs:

---

### 1. **Prepare Data for Analysis in Power BI** 🧹
In this lab, I focused on importing and transforming raw data into a clean format ready for analysis in Power BI.  

**Key Skills Learned:**
- **Importing Data** from multiple sources (e.g., Excel, CSV files).
- **Data Transformation** using Power Query Editor to remove blanks, fix data types, and clean columns.
- **Merging Tables** to create a consolidated dataset for analysis.

🌟 **Tip:** It’s essential to clean your data before analysing it, as raw data can often be messy and inconsistent!

---

### 2. **Clean and Transform Data in Power BI** 🧽  
This lab took my data transformation skills to the next level, where I learned how to handle missing values, duplicates, and complex data issues.  

**Key Skills Learned:**
- **Replacing Missing Data** using Power Query.
- **Removing Duplicates** to prevent data skewing.
- **Splitting Columns** to extract useful information from combined data columns.
- **Filling Gaps** in data with default values or calculated columns.

🌟 **Tip:** Cleaning data isn’t just about removing errors—it’s about enhancing the dataset to make it easier to analyse and report!

---

### 3. **Design a Data Model in Power BI** 🏗️  
In this lab, I dived into designing efficient data models for analysis, ensuring that the relationships between tables are correct and optimized.  

**Key Skills Learned:**
- **Creating Relationships** between different tables to enable cross-table analysis.
- **Star Schema Modeling** for simplified analysis.
- **Understanding Cardinality** and how to set relationships correctly (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many).

🌟 **Tip:** A well-designed data model is like the foundation of a house—it supports everything else!

---

### 4. **Create Effective Reports in Power BI** 📊  
The goal of this lab was to build visually effective reports that communicate data insights clearly and efficiently.  

**Key Skills Learned:**
- **Creating Interactive Reports** with slicers, filters, and drill-throughs.
- **Choosing the Right Visualizations** based on the data and the audience.
- **Customizing Reports** for clarity and impact.

🌟 **Tip:** A good report tells a story. Always think about your audience when selecting visual elements!

---

### 5. **DAX in Power BI - Adding Measures** 📐  
The final lab focused on **DAX** (Data Analysis Expressions) to create powerful custom measures and calculations for deeper data analysis.  

**Key Skills Learned:**
- **Creating Calculated Columns** using DAX to add custom fields to my data model.
- **Using DAX Functions** such as `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `CALCULATE`, and `IF`.
- **Working with Time Intelligence** for period-based analysis (e.g., year-over-year calculations).

🌟 **Tip:** DAX is an incredibly powerful tool for adding advanced calculations that can dramatically improve your reports and dashboards!
